# Problem 1

### Part a

The Washington Post has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S.
cities and made the data available through a GitHub repository here. You
can read their accompanying article here.

- Create a `city_state` variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary
  variable indicating whether the homicide is solved.
- Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t
  report victim race.
- Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake.
- For this problem, limit your analysis those for whom victim_race is
  white or black.
- Be sure that victim_age is numeric.

``` r
homicide_data <- read_csv("homicide-data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "),
         solved = as_factor(if_else(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Closed by arrest"), 1, 0)),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>%
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"),
         victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"))
```

### Part b

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the glm function to fit a logistic
regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age,
sex and race as predictors.

- Save the output of glm as an R object;
- apply the broom::tidy to this object;
- and obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds
  ratio for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims
  keeping all other variables fixed.

``` r
# data for Baltimore, MD
baltimore_data <- homicide_data %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

# logistic regression for Baltimore
baltimore_glm <- glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, 
                     family = binomial, 
                     data = baltimore_data)

# save the model output and tidy it
baltimore_model_tidied <- broom::tidy(baltimore_glm)

# extract the estimate and confidence interval for male vs female victims
baltimore_coefs <- coef(summary(baltimore_glm))

male_female_or <- exp(baltimore_coefs["victim_sexMale", "Estimate"])
male_female_or_ci <- exp(confint(baltimore_glm)["victim_sexMale",])
```

    ## Waiting for profiling to be done...

The estimate of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing
male victims to female victims keeping all other variables fixed is
0.3546711 and the confidence interval is (0.2672667, 0.4679109).

### Part c

Now run glm for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the
adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims.

Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map, list
columns, and unnest as necessary to create a dataframe with estimated
ORs and CIs for each city.

``` r
# Assuming your data is in a dataframe called cleaned_data

# Define a function to perform glm and extract the necessary information
run_glm <- function(df) {
  glm_model = glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, family = binomial, data = df)
  tidy_glm = broom::tidy(glm_model)
  confint_glm = confint(glm_model)
  
  # Extract the estimate, std. error, and CI for victim_sexMale
  tidy_glm %>%
    filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>%
    mutate(
      or = exp(estimate),
      lower_ci = exp(confint_glm["victim_sexMale", "2.5 %"]),
      upper_ci = exp(confint_glm["victim_sexMale", "97.5 %"])
    )
}

# Apply the function to each subset of data for each city
city_models <- homicide_data %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(model = purrr::map(data, run_glm)) %>%
  select(-data) %>%
  unnest(model)
```

    ## Warning: There were 43 warnings in `mutate()`.
    ## The first warning was:
    ## ℹ In argument: `model = purrr::map(data, run_glm)`.
    ## ℹ In group 1: `city_state = "Albuquerque, NM"`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred
    ## ℹ Run `dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings()` to see the 42 remaining warnings.

### Part d

Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.
Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.

``` r
# Create a plot of the odds ratios
ggplot(city_models, aes(x = reorder(city_state, or), y = or)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_ci, ymax = upper_ci), width = 0.25) +
  coord_flip() +  # flip the axes 
  xlab("City") +
  ylab("Odds Ratio") +
  ggtitle("Adjusted Odds Ratios with CI for Solving Homicides (Male vs Female Victims)")
```

**Comments**

- The ORs for most cities are less than 1, suggesting that, after
  keeping all other variables fixed, homicides with female victims are
  more likely to be solved than those with male victims.
- The cities at the top of the plot, such as Fresno, CA, and
  Minneapolis, MN, have ORs greater than 1, indicating a relatively
  higher likelihood of solving cases with male victims in these cities.
- Some cities, like Tulsa, OK, and Nashville, TN, have confidence
  intervals that cross the OR of 1, suggesting that there is no
  statistically significant difference in the likelihood of solving
  homicides between male and female victims in those cities.
- The confidence intervals for cities like Fresno, CA, do not cross 1,
  suggesting a statistically significant difference in the likelihood of
  solving homicides with male victims compared to female victims.
